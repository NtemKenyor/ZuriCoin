# We have three stages/kinds of transactions.
# Pending transactions, Verified Transactions and Failed Transactions...
# When ever a user initializise a transaction, It would enter the pending list of transactions.
# Miners would verify the opperation by finding the nonce and checking if the hash are same.

#a hacker tries to bridge the blockchain and the miners can not verify the transactions, the transaction 
#enters the failed state.

#A database may be involved to store transactions and indicating their states.
